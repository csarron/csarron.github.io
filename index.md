  I'm a Computer Science PhD candidate at Stony Brook University. My research interests are NLP applications, mobile systems and edge computing. More recently, I study deep learning applications (question answering, machine translation, conversational bots etc.), systems (DL frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch) and hardware (mobile GPUs, accelerators such as [Movidis NCS](https://developer.movidius.com/) and [Edge TPU](https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/edge-tpu/)). I'm a member of [NetSys Lab](https://netsys.cs.stonybrook.edu/) directed by Prof. [Aruna Balasubramanian](http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~arunab/index.html). I also work closely with Prof. [Niranjan Balasubramanian](http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~niranjan/index.html).
