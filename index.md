  [Talk version](/bio.html). I am a graduating Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at Stony Brook University. My research topics are natural language processing (NLP), mobile computing, and machine learning systems. I have focused on building efficient and practical NLP systems for both edge devices and the cloud, such as on-device question answering (MobiSys 2019), faster Transformer models (ACL 2020), and accurate energy estimation of NLP models. I have two fantastic advisors: Prof. [Aruna Balasubramanian](http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~arunab/index.html) and Prof. [Niranjan Balasubramanian](http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~niranjan/index.html). I'm on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vLpPyUUAAAAJ) and [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/31961604).
  <br>
  <span class="update">Updates</span>: I'm looking for **postdoc** openings in academia or **research** positions in the industry.
