  Qingqing Cao is a postdoc working with Prof. [Hannaneh Hajishirzi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~hannaneh/index.html) in the [UW NLP group](https://www.cs.washington.edu/research/nlp) at University of Washington. He obtained a computer science Ph.D. at Stony Brook University where he worked with Prof. [Aruna Balasubramanian](http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~arunab/index.html) and Prof. [Niranjan Balasubramanian](http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~niranjan/index.html). His research interests include efficient NLP, mobile computing, and ML systems. He has focused on building efficient and practical NLP systems for both edge devices and the cloud, such as on-device (visual) question answering (MobiSys 2019, IMWUT 2022), faster Transformer models (ACL 2020), and accurate energy estimation of NLP models (ACL 2021). He was a recipient of the Catacosinos Fellowship at Stony Brook University and a Rising Star in Data Science at the University of Chicago. His website is [awk.ai](https://awk.ai). 

#   <span class="update">Updates</span>: I joined [H2Lab](https://h2lab.cs.washington.edu/) at UW as a postdoc!  <br>

  <span class="update">Note</span>: If you are an undergraduate or master's student and would like to do research with me (during summer or other times), please complete [this questionnaire](https://forms.gle/MyUVaLBY8CzxA4Ye8), then send me an email with subject "student project application submitted: your name". 
  <br>
  Example research topics include: (1) improving storage/memory/compute efficiency of retrieval augmented (generation) models (e.g. build faster open-domain QA models like [FiD](https://github.com/facebookresearch/FiD)); (2) building fast/light-weight/energy-efficient language and vision systems; (3) optimizing/co-designing algorithms and systems for efficient on-device AI applications (e.g. using tools like [TVM](https://github.com/apache/tvm) or [IREE](https://github.com/google/iree) to optimize deployment of DNN/Transformer-based applications). I am generally interested in building efficient models and practical systems for sustainable NLP/AI, so I am happy to collaborate on other possible projects in efficient AI areas.
